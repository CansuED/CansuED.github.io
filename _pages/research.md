At the heart of my interdisciplinary research are concerns at the intersection of technology, equity, and sustainability. 

**Research Interests**: Technology, work, and organizations; Data, data practices, data work; Community engaged research; Non-profits, mission driven organizations; Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD)

**Current Research**: My current research explores the role of artificial intelligence in public service delivery. I am the Principal Investigator on Insight Development Grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the recipient of numerous competitive internal grants and awards from McMaster University.


My broad research agenda examines sustainable socio-technical systems. Empirically, I concentrate on organizations and communities and the complex social and ethical interplay surrounding them, shaping their use of information technologies. Methodologically, I draw on mixed methods (interviews, statistics, participant observation, along with archival research, participatory and community-driven design) applied both at the local and global levels.

My research on sustainability and information technologies can be classified into two interconnected areas:

### Sustainable Development, Organizations, Migration & Immigrant Integration

In alignment with the *2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals*, which recognize migration as a powerful driver of sustainable development for migrants, their communities, and the host countries, my research agenda has involved close collaboration with migrant communities, non-profit and humanitarian service organizations, refugee entrepreneurs, startups, and policymakers.

Drawing on the literatures from information science, data studies and human-computer interaction, my dissertation research demonstrates how the sustainable digital transformation of immigrant-serving agencies and the social and economic integration of their newcomer clients into Canadian society are interrelated. Critically, it highlights why promoting the responsible design and use of technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, in settlement service delivery is a necessary step in addressing social and digital inequities and the data privacy needs and challenges of disadvantaged groups. Moreover, my dissertation demonstrates broader challenges impacting the sustainable social and economic integration of new Canadians, including digital inclusion and equitable access to digital literacy and resources.

### Sustainability & Socially and Digitally Inclusive Communities

Another strand of my research focuses on the role of information technologies in promoting sustainable futures for marginalized communities as they navigate structural inequities in health, well-being and work. I examine some pressing questions at both theoretical and practical levels and both locally and globally, including the links between information infrastructures and citizenship practices, the information-wise transitions of refugees and digital humanitarian work.
