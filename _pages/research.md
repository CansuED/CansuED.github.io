My research examines the use and design of digital technologies to drive managerial, organizational, and community growth, with a particular focus on technology, work, and sustainability in a global context. 

My academic articles have been published in venues including Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI), and the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction.

My current research explores the role of artificial intelligence in public service delivery. I am the Principal Investigator on Insight Development Grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the recipient of numerous competitive internal grants and awards from McMaster University.
