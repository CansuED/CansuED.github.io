I am an [Assistant Professor of Information Systems](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/profiles/ekmekcic/) in the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 

At McMaster, I direct **D^4 Sustainable Futures Lab**. I am also affiliated with the [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA)](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/cansu-ekmekcioglu/) and [The McMaster Centre for Research on Employment and Work (MCREW)](https://mcrew.ca/).


I completed my Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Toronto, and hold a B.A. in Political Science, as well as a M.A. in Digital Media and Communications. With over 10 years of experience in researching and consulting on technology projects related to migration, humanitarian efforts, and international development, I have worked closely with industry, non-profit, humanitarian aid, and policy sectors.
