I am an [Assistant Professor of Information Systems](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/profiles/ekmekcic/) in the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 

At McMaster, I direct **D^4 Sustainable Futures Lab**. 

I lead *Sustainable Futures Hub* at [The McLean Centre for Collaborative Discovery (MCCD)](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/about/mclean-centre-for-collaborative-discovery/). I also co-lead McMaster University’s efforts to develop and advance the *Plenary Health* graduate program.

I am a member of [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA)](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/cansu-ekmekcioglu/) and [The McMaster Centre for Research on Employment and Work (MCREW)](https://mcrew.ca/).


I have a Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Toronto's [Faculty of Information (iSchool)](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), a Master's Degree in Media and Communication from Galatasaray University, and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and International Relations from Bogazici University. In previous lives, I worked as a consultant on technology initiatives in humanitarian and international development contexts and also managed two companies in insurance and information technology.
