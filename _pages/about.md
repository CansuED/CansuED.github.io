I am an [Assistant Professor of Information Systems](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/profiles/ekmekcic/) in the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. 

At McMaster, I direct **D^4 Sustainable Futures Lab**. I am a member of [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA)](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/cansu-ekmekcioglu/) and [The McMaster Centre for Research on Employment and Work (MCREW)](https://mcrew.ca/).


I have a Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Toronto, a Master's Degree in Media and Communication from Galatasaray University, and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and International Relations from Bogazici University. With over 10 years of experience in researching and consulting on technology projects related to migration, humanitarian efforts, and international development, I have worked closely with industry, non-profit, humanitarian aid, and policy sectors.
