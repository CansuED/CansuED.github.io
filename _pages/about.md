I am a doctoral student in the Faculty of Information at University of Toronto, and a teaching associate in the Institute of Communication, Culture, Information, and Technology (ICCIT) at University of Toronto Mississauga. I am also part of the ThirdSpace Lab(https://thirdspace.toronto.edu/) in the Department of Computer Science.
