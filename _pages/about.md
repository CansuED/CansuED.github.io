Hi! I'm Cansu Ekmekcioglu.
I am an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the [DeGroote School of Business, McMaster University](https://research.degroote.mcmaster.ca/academic-areas/information-systems/). I am a member of [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA)](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/cansu-ekmekcioglu/) and [The McMaster Centre for Research on Employment and Work (MCREW)](https://mcrew.ca/). 

My research focuses on the intersection of information systems and sustainability, examining the use and design of new technologies to drive sustainable managerial, organizational, and community growth. My current research explores the role of artificial intelligence and data-driven technologies in advancing sustainable development goals. 

I earned my Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Toronto, and I hold a B.A. in Political Science and International Relations from Bogazici University, as well as a M.A. in Digital Media and Communications from Galatasaray University. 

With over 10 years of experience in researching and consulting on technology projects related to migration, humanitarian efforts, and international development, I have worked closely with industry, non-profit, humanitarian aid, and policy sectors. I am affiliated with the Critical Computing Group, and the Centre for Refugee Studies at York University. In 2023, I was named a New Leader of the Association for Information Science and Technology.
