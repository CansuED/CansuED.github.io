I am an [Assistant Professor of Information Systems](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/profiles/ekmekcic/) in the DeGroote School of Business at McMaster University. I direct [**D^4 Sustainable Futures Lab**](lab.md).

At McMaster, I lead the **Sustainable Futures Hub** at [The McLean Centre for Collaborative Discovery (MCCD)](https://degroote.mcmaster.ca/about/mclean-centre-for-collaborative-discovery/). I also co-lead the University’s efforts to develop and advance the *Plenary Health* graduate program. I am a member of [McMaster Institute for Research on Aging (MIRA)](https://mira.mcmaster.ca/our-faculty/cansu-ekmekcioglu/) and [The McMaster Centre for Research on Employment and Work (MCREW)](https://mcrew.ca/).

My research examines the use and design of data and digital technologies to foster innovation at the managerial, organizational, and community levels with a particular focus on sustainability. 

My current research explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in public service delivery. I am the Principal Investigator on an Insight Development Grant funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the recipient of several competitive internal grants and awards from McMaster University.

My academic contributions have been published in venues including *Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology*, *ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)*, and the *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction*. I am the Canada Chapter Lead of [Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIST)](https://www.asist.org/) in 2025-2026.

I have a Ph.D. in Information Science from the University of Toronto's [Faculty of Information (iSchool)](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/), a Master's Degree in Media & Communication from Galatasaray University, and a Bachelor's Degree in Political Science and International Relations from Bogazici University. In previous lives, I worked as a consultant on technology initiatives in humanitarian and international development contexts and also managed two companies in insurance and IT.
