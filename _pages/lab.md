Welcome to the lab! 
At D^4 Sustainable Futures, we harness the power of **D**igital, **D**ata, **D**esign, and **D**evelopment to imagine and build **Sustainable Futures**.
We investigate the intersections between human-centred computing, sustainability, and the public good. Our research seeks to identify how technology and digitally mediated service infrastructures can improve, protect, or potentially hinder the delivery of sustainable, inclusive, and non-rivalrous public goods and services. These include, but are not limited to, migration and settlement services,  disaster response, access to sustainable employment and education opportunities, and defence and security.

We welcome partnerships with government agencies, international organizations, non-profits, social service providers, and community groups eager to leverage technology in building equitable and resilient futures.
