      <h2>Welcome to the Lab</h2>
      <p>We investigate the intersections between human-centered computing, sustainability, and the public good. Our research seeks to identify how technology and digitally mediated service infrastructures can improve, protect, or potentially hinder the delivery of sustainable, inclusive, and non-rivalrous public goods and services.</p>
      <p>These include, but are not limited to, social service delivery, disaster response, access to sustainable employment and education opportunities, and defence and security.</p>
